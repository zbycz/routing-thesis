<h2><a name="H_1_1"></a>Program Usage</h2>

There are five programs that make up this software.  The first one takes the
planet.osm datafile from OpenStreetMap (or other source of data using the same
formats) and converts it into a local database.  The second program uses the
database to determine an optimum route between two points.  The third program
allows visualisation of the data and statistics to be extracted.  The fourth
program allows dumping the raw parsed data for test purposes and the fifth is a
test program for the tag transformations.

<h3><a name="H_1_1_1"></a>planetsplitter</h3>

This program reads in the OSM format XML file and splits it up to create the
database that is used for routing.

</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>--help
  <dd>Prints out the help information.
  <dt>--dir=&lt;dirname&gt;
  <dd>Sets the directory name in which to save the results.
    Defaults to the current directory.
  <dt>--prefix=&lt;name&gt;
  <dd>Sets the filename prefix for the files that are created.
    Defaults to no prefix.
  <dt>--sort-ram-size=&lt;size&gt;
  <dd>Specifies the amount of RAM (in MB) to use for sorting the data.  If not
    specified then 64 MB will be used in slim mode or 256 MB otherwise.
  <dt>--sort-threads=&lt;number&gt;
  <dd>The number of threads to use for data sorting (the sorting memory is
    shared between the threads - too many threads and not enough memory will
    reduce the performance).
  <dt>--tmpdir=&lt;dirname&gt;
  <dd>Specifies the name of the directory to store the temporary disk files.  If
    not specified then it defaults to either the value of the --dir option or the
    current directory.
  <dt>--tagging=&lt;filename&gt;
  <dd>Sets the filename containing the list of tagging rules in XML format for
    the parsing the input files.  If the file doesn't exist then dirname, prefix
    and "profiles.xml" will be combined and used, if that doesn't exist then the
    file '/usr/local/share/routino/profiles.xml' (or custom installation
    location) will be used.
  <dt>--loggable
  <dd>Print progress messages that are suitable for logging to a file; normally
    an incrementing counter is printed which is more suitable for real-time
    display than logging.
  <dt>--logtime
  <dd>Print the elapsed time for each processing step.
  <dt>--errorlog[=&lt;name&gt;]
  <dd>Log OSM parsing and processing errors to 'error.log' or the specified file
    name (the '--dir' and '--prefix' options are applied).  If the --append
    option is used then the existing log file will be appended, otherwise a new
    one will be created.
  <dt>--parse-only
  <dd>Parse the input files and store the data in intermediate files but don't
    process the data into a routing database.  This option must be used with the
    --append option for all except the first file.
  <dt>--process-only
  <dd>Don't read in any files but process the existing intermediate files
    created by using the --parse-only option.
  <dt>--append
  <dd>Parse the input file and append the result to the existing intermediate
    files; the appended file can be either an OSM file or an OSC change file.
  <dt>--keep
  <dd>Store a set of intermediate files after parsing the OSM files, sorting and
    removing duplicates; this allows appending an OSC file and re-processing
    later.
  <dt>--changes
  <dd>This option indicates that the data being processed contains one or more
    OSC (OSM changes) files, they must be applied in time sequence if more than
    one is used.  This option implies --append when parsing data files and
    --keep when processing data.
  <dt>--max-iterations=&lt;number&gt;
  <dd>The maximum number of iterations to use when generating super-nodes and
    super-segments.  Defaults to 5 which is normally enough.
  <dt>--prune-none
  <dd>Disable the prune options below, they can be re-enabled by adding them to
    the command line after this option.
  <dt>--prune-isolated=&lt;length&gt;
  <dd>Remove the access permissions for a transport type from small disconnected
    groups of segments and remove the segments if they nd up with no access
    permission (defaults to removing groups under 500m).
  <dt>--prune-short=&lt;length&gt;
  <dd>Remove short segments (defaults to removing segments up to a maximum
    length of 5m).
  <dt>--prune-straight=&lt;length&gt;
  <dd>Remove nodes in almost straight highways (defaults to removing nodes up to
    3m offset from a straight line).
  <dt>&lt;filename.osm&gt;, &lt;filename.osc&gt;, &lt;filename.pbf&gt;, &lt;filename.o5m&gt;, &lt;filename.o5c&gt;
  <dd>Specifies the filename(s) to read data from.  Filenames ending '.pbf' will
    be read as PBF, filenames ending in '.o5m' or '.o5c' will be read as
    O5M/O5C, otherwise as XML.  Filenames ending '.bz2' will be bzip2
    uncompressed (if bzip2 support compiled in).  Filenames ending '.gz' will be
    gzip uncompressed (if gzip support compiled in).
</dl>

<p>
<i>Note: In version 1.4 of Routino the --transport, --not-highway and
--not-property options have been removed.  The same functionality can be
achieved by editing the tagging rules file to not output unwanted data.</i>

<p>
<i>Note: In version 1.5 of Routino the --slim option has been removed but at
compilation time a separate program called <em>planetsplitter-slim</em> is
created that operates in slim mode.  In slim mode the temporary files and
database files are read as needed rather than being mapped into memory.  This
allows a database size greater than 2 GB on 32-bit machines or usage with little
or no virtual memory (e.g. some virtual machines).  The penalty for this is that
the program takes about twice as long to run.</i>

<p>
<i>Note: In version 2.5 of Routino the ability to read data from the standard
input has been removed.  This is because there is now the ability to read
compressed files (bzip2 and gzip) and PBF files directly.  Also using standard
input the file type cannot be auto-detected from the filename.</i>

<p>
Example usage 1:

<pre class="boxed">
planetsplitter --dir=data --prefix=gb great_britain.osm
</pre>

This will generate the output files 'data/gb-nodes.mem', 'data/gb-segments.mem'
and 'data/gb-ways.mem'.  Multiple filenames can be specified on the command
line and they will all be read in, combined and processed together.

<p>
Example usage 2:

<pre class="boxed">
planetsplitter --dir=data --prefix=gb --parse-only          great_britain_part1.osm
planetsplitter --dir=data --prefix=gb --parse-only --append great_britain_part2.osm
planetsplitter --dir=data --prefix=gb --parse-only --append ...
planetsplitter --dir=data --prefix=gb --process-only
</pre>

This will generate the same output files as the first example but parsing the
input files is performed separately from the data processing.  The first file
read in must not use the --append option but the later ones must.

<p>
Example usage 3:

<pre class="boxed">
planetsplitter --dir=data --prefix=gb --keep    great_britain.osm

planetsplitter --dir=data --prefix=gb --changes great_britain.osc
</pre>

This will generate the same output files as the first example.  The first
command will process the complete file and keep some intermediate data for
later.  The second command will apply a set of changes to the stored
intermediate data and keep the updated intermediate files for repeating this
step later with more change data.
<p>
The parsing and processing can be split into multiple commands as it was in
example 2 with the --keep option used with --process-only for the initial OSM
file(s) and the --changes option used with --parse-only or --process-only for
every OSC file.

      obey them when walking).  Default value depends on the profile selected by
      the --transport option.
  <dt>--turns=[0|1]
  <dd>Selects if turn restrictions are to be obeyed (useful to not obey them
      when walking).  Default value depends on the profile selected by the
      --transport option.
  <dt>--weight=&lt;weight&gt;
  <dd>Specifies the weight of the mode of transport in tonnes; ensures that the
      weight limit on the highway is not exceeded.  Default value depends on the
      profile selected by the --transport option.
  <dt>--height=&lt;height&gt;
  <dd>Specifies the height of the mode of transport in metres; ensures that the
      height limit on the highway is not exceeded.  Default value depends on the

<p>
<i>Note: In version 1.5 of Routino a slim option has been added and at
compilation time a separate program called <em>router-slim</em> is created that
operates in slim mode.  In slim mode the database files are read as needed
rather than being mapped into memory.</i>

<p>
The meaning of the &lt;preference&gt; parameter in the command line options is
slightly different for the highway preferences and the property preferences.
For the highway preference consider the choice between two possible highways
between the start and finish when looking for the shortest route.  If highway A
has a preference of 100% and highway B has a preference of 90% then highway A
will be chosen even if it is up to 11% longer (100/90 = 111%).  For the highway
properties each highway either has a particular property or not.  If the
preference for the property is 60% then a highway with the property has a
preference of 77% (sqrt(60%)) and one without has a preference of 63%
(sqrt(100-60%)).  A highway with the property will be chosen even if it is up to
22% longer than one without the property (77/63 = 122%).  The overall preference
for each highway segment is the product of the preference for the highway type
and all of the preferences for the highway properties.

<p>
Example usage (motorcycle journey, scenic route, not very fast):

<pre class="boxed">
router --dir=data --prefix=gb --transport=motorcycle --highway-motorway=0 \
       --highway-trunk=0 --speed-primary=80 --speed-secondary=80 --quickest
</pre>

This will use the files 'data/gb-nodes.mem', 'data/gb-segments.mem' and
'data/gb-ways.mem' to find the quickest route by motorcycle not using motorways
or trunk roads and not exceeding 80 km/hr.

  <dt>--dump
  <dd>Selects a data dumping mode which allows looking at individual items in
    the databases (specifying 'all' instead of a number dumps all of them).
    More than one of the following parameters can be specified on the command
    line.
    <dl>
      <dt>--node=&lt;node&gt;
      <dd>Prints the information about the selected node number (internal
        number, not the node id number in the original source file).
      <dt>--segment=&lt;segment&gt;
      <dd>Prints the information about the selected segment number.
      <dt>--way=&lt;way&gt;
      <dd>Prints the information about the selected way number (internal
        number, not the way id number in the original source file).
      <dt>--turn-relation=&lt;relation&gt;
      <dd>Prints the information about the selected turn relation number
        (internal number, not the relation id number in the original source
        file).
    </dl>
  <dt>--osm-dump
  <dd>Dumps the contents of the database as an OSM format XML file, the whole
    database will be dumped unless the latitude and longitude ranges are
    specified.
    <dl>
      <dt>--no-super
      <dd>The super segments will not be output.
      <dt>--latmin=&lt;latmin&gt; --latmax=&lt;latmax&gt;
      <dd>The range of latitudes to dump the data for.
      <dt>--lonmin=&lt;lonmin&gt; --lonmax=&lt;lonmax&gt;
      <dd>The range of longitudes to dump the data for.
    </dl>
</dl>

<i>Note: In version 1.5 of Routino a slim option has been added and at
compilation time a separate program called <em>filedumper-slim</em> is created
that operates in slim mode.  In slim mode the database files are read as needed
rather than being mapped into memory.</i>


<h3><a name="H_1_1_4"></a>filedumperx</h3>

This program is a modified version of filedumper that will dump out the contents
of the intermediate data that is saved by planetsplitter after processing using
the --keep or --changes option.  This is intended for test purposes only and
gives no useful information about the routing database.

<pre class="boxed">
Usage: filedumper [--help]
                  [--dir=&lt;dirname&gt;] [--prefix=&lt;name&gt;]
                  [--dump [--nodes]
                          [--segments]
                          [--ways]

                          [--turn-relations]]
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>--help
  <dd>Prints out the help information.
  <dt>--dir=&lt;dirname&gt;
  <dd>Sets the directory name in which to read the local database.
    Defaults to the current directory.
  <dt>--prefix=&lt;name&gt;
  <dd>Sets the filename prefix for the files in the local database.
  <dt>--dump
  <dd>Dumps the complete set of data in the intermediate files that are written
    by planetsplitter using the --keep or --changes options.
    <dl>
      <dt>--nodes
      <dd>Dumps the node data.
      <dt>--segments
      <dd>Dumps the segment data.
      <dt>--ways
      <dd>Dumps the way data.
      <dt>--route-relations
      <dd>Dumps the route relation data.
      <dt>--turn-relations
      <dd>Dumps the turn relation data.
    </dl>
</dl>


<h3><a name="H_1_1_5"></a>tagmodifier</h3>

This program is used to run the tag transformation process on an OSM XML file
for test purposes.

<pre class="boxed">
Usage: tagmodifier [--help]
                   [--tagging=&lt;filename&gt;]
                   [--loggable] [--logtime]
                   [--errorlog[&lt;name&gt;]]
                   [&lt;filename.osm&gt; | &lt;filename.osm.bz2&gt; | &lt;filename.osm.gz&gt;]
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>--help
  <dd>Prints out the help information.
  <dt>--tagging=&lt;filename&gt;
  <dd>The name of the XML file containing the tagging rules (defaults to
    'tagging.xml' in the current directory).
  <dt>--loggable
  <dd>Print progress messages that are suitable for logging to a file; normally
    an incrementing counter is printed which is more suitable for real-time
    display than logging.
  <dt>--logtime
    <dd>Print the elapsed time for the processing.
  <dt>--errorlog[=&lt;name&gt;]
    <dd>Log parsing errors to 'error.log' or the specified file name.
  <dt>&lt;filename.osm&gt;
  <dd>Specifies the filename(s) to read data from.  Filenames ending '.bz2' will
    be bzip2 uncompressed (if bzip2 support compiled in).  Filenames ending
    '.gz' will be gzip uncompressed (if gzip support compiled in).
